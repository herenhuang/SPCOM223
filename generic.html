									<h3 class="major">Determining Goals</h3>
									<p>Waterloo is home to over a hundred programs that lead you to all careers imaginable. Just because you're not taking the same path as someone else doesn't mean you won't end up in the same place in terms of happiness and self-defined success.</p>
                                    
                                    
									<h3 class="major">Talk to new people</h3>
									<p>Residence is a great place to meet people from other faculties. Socialize with people on your floor, your building, or off campus! Making friends will allow you to understand and accept each others differences.</p>
                                    
                                    <h3 class="major">Join extracurriculars</h3>
									<p>Join clubs and activities in things you believe in! You'll find people from a wide range of programs and backgrounds that have similar interests to you, and meet people you otherwise wouldn't through your area of study.</p>
                                    
                                    <h3 class="major">Be part of the solution</h3>
									<p>Have you ever bragged to your friends about your Friday off while theyâ€™re struggling to get their 5000 word essay done at the 11th hour? Make sure that you support and respect friends and colleagues that have different schedules and course loads than you. These people might end up being your future employers or coworkers!</p>

							<p>As a first year student, transitioning to a new school, new program, new city can be hard. Reach out to your friends and each other, and lend a helping hand or a sympathetic ear.</p>
